Installing

Software Requirements
---------------------

* pyyaml - aka python-yaml
* libclutter >= 1.2
* libclutter-gst >= 1.0
* pyclutter > 1.0
* pyclutter-gst > 1.0


Installing Needed Libraries
---------------------------

Copies of gyparody software can be retrieved by::

  git clone http://brandonedens.org/git/gyparody.git

To execute the software you will need clutter >= 1.2 and pyclutter > 1.0. This
software is relatively new (as of 2010-04-21) with libclutter 1.2 version not
available in Ubuntu Karmic Koala.

Therefore we must install the software from what is available on Clutter's
website at: http://clutter-project.org/download.html

The latest (possibly unstable versions can be obtained by executing)::

  git clone git://git.clutter-project.org/clutter
  git clone git://git.clutter-project.org/clutter-gst
  git clone git://git.clutter-project.org/bindings/pyclutter
  git clone git://git.clutter-project.org/bindings/pyclutter-gst

See clutter's git web interface at: http://git.clutter-project.org/

Building Git versions of Clutter
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To build the git versions of clutter, enter the directory containing the
downloaded software and execute::

  ./autogen.sh
  make
  sudo make install


Building Gyparody
-----------------

Gyparody can be executed from the directory in which it was
downloaded. However, it can also be installed into Python or build as a
Ubuntu/Debian .deb file for installation via dpkg/apt-get. We cover each method
in turn.

Executing Gyparody (in place)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To execute gyparody from a git checked out version first set your Python path
to the current working directory via::

  export PYTHONPATH=".:$PYTHONPATH"

Then run gyparody via::

  ./bin/gyparody

Installing into Python Path library
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Make sure that you have python setuptools installed. Then execute::

  python setup.py build
  sudo python setup.py install

Copy the ./bin/gyparody file to somewhere in your path aka::

  sudo cp bin/gyparody /usr/local/bin/

Installing via Ubuntu/Debian
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Enter the directory containing the gyparody

Ubuntu users may elect to utilize Gyparody's build system for creating a .deb
file that can be installed by apt-get. To do this execute the following::

  dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot
  sudo dpkg -i ../gyparody_*_i386.deb
